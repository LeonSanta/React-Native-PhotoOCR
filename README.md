# React-Native-PictureOCR
Combine React-Native-Camere and React-Native-Text-Detector for picture OCR 
can detect photo's word as seperate lines from gallery or camera.

Recommend using camera from the apps instead of Built-in for higher precision of picture

I also combine React-Native-Tesseract-ocr and React-Native-Image-Picker as a Test Group of Percision.
